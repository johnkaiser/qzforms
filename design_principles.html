<h1> QZ Forms Design Principles </h1>

<dl>

<dt>Goal</dt>
<dd>
Code free creation of web forms from a PostgreSQL database.
</dd>

<dt>Database Choice</dt>
<dd>
Database neutrality is for wimps. Postgres Rulez!
All features of PostgreSQL may be used.
</dd>

<dt>Web user === PostgreSQL user</dt>
<dd>
The application does not have a password hidden someplace.
When a user logs in, it is Postgres that validates the user.
When the application connects to Postgres, it is as the logged in user.
</dd>
 
<dt>Text Strings</dt>
<dd>
Form data is moved as text strings.
Binary data is forbidden.
</dd>

<dt>UTF8</dt>
<dd>
UTF8 is the one true character encoding.
All others are heresy.
Data that is not UTF8 is bad, should feel bad,
and should aspire to be converted to UTF8.
</dd>

<dt> Avoid Duplicitous Redundancy </dt>
<dd>
Metadata in Postgres, such as data type, 
should be carried through the process and not
repeated.  
Javascript on the client should know the PG type. 
</dd>

<dt> No printf(&quot;&lt;input type=text...</dt>
<dd>
The application builds a web page as an xml tree of nodes with libxml2.
At no time should the application print text for display.
</dd>

<dt> Little Bobby Tables is welcome </dt>
<dd>
<a href='http://xkcd.com/327/'>http://xkcd.com/327/</a>
Database transactions are to be done with prepared statements.
